      New York Apartment combines the totality of New York real estate into a single website, sourced from every single for-sale listing in New York City. The site includes hundreds of thousands of images, video tours, descriptive sentences, 3d structures generated from extruded floor plans, and a mortgage calculator.

      New York Apartment was made in collaboration with Tega Brain. It was a commission from the Whitney Museum for the Artport collection, curated by Christiane Paul.

      Perfect Sleep investigates sleep and dreaming as a potential climate engineering technology. By inviting participants to experiment with their own sleep cycles, the work explores how lack of sleep and climate change are both products of the same extractivist capitalist system where regeneration, rest and natural limits go unvalued. The work is realized in two parts: as a smart phone app and an installation. The app allows users to adjust their daily schedule, slowly increasing their sleep time over the course of three years until they achieve a state of ‘total sleep,' and includes a series of dream incubation texts written by Simone Browne, Johanna Hedva, Holly Jean Buck, and Sophie Lewis. In the installation the dreamscapes can be experienced from custom daybeds.

      This work is a collaboration with Tega Brain, as a commission for Museum Sinclair-Haus, and received an Award of Distinction from Prix Ars Electronica.

      A massive e-card comprised of over 200,000 unique messages of well wishes. The messages are sourced from the popular crowd funding site gofundme.com, a self-described “leader in online medical fundraising”, which, due to lack of affordable healthcare in the United States is widely relied upon for funding vital medical procedures. The piece is accompanied by a short essay from Johanna Hedva.

      Get Well Soon was made in collaboration with Tega Brain. It was shown as part of the online exhibit We=Link, co-commissioned by Chronus Art Center (Shanghai), Art Center Nabi (Seoul) and Rhizome/The New Museum (New York). It was described as a "defining artwork of 2020" by ARTnews.

      A downloadable application and website that raises money for bail funds by mining cryptocurrency.

      When users download the app, a small part of their computer’s unused processing power is redirected toward mining the Monero cryptocurrency, which is secure, private, and untraceable. At the end of every month, the Monero is exchanged for US dollars which are then donated to the Bronx Freedom Fund.
